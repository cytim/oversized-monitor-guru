# OMG - Oversized Monitor Guru

When you have a massive display, sharing your entire screen can make content appear tiny and unreadable for meeting participants. Many conferencing apps, like Google Meet and Microsoft Teams, lack the option to share only a specific screen area. This Chrome Extension solves this by allowing users to mirror a selected portion of their screen in a separate window, simplifying the sharing of targeted content in virtual meetings.

Watch the demo below to see OMG in action.

## Installation for Developers

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Load the `src` folder as [Unpacked Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked)

## How to Use

**Setting Up the Mirror:**

1. Click the OMG extension icon
2. Adjust the mirror area using the size and offset controls
3. Hit "Start Mirroring" to create your mirror window
4. Choose to share your _entire screen_ or a specific _window_
5. Position the mirror window at a corner

**During Your Meeting:**

1. Start screen sharing in your conferencing app
2. Select the `OMG` mirror _window_ to share (not your main screen)

## Limitation

- üõ†Ô∏è **Tab mirroring not supported** - OMG works with windows and full screens only
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è **Keep mirror somehow visible** - Completely hiding the mirror window behind other apps may cause freezing in Google Meet, as the platform pauses rendering for "inactive" windows
